Cracks in concrete and pavements, although they seemingly harmless, can gradually pose safety hazards if left untreated. Hence, early detection of cracks on walls, floors, or roads is critical to maintaining their structural integrity and prolonging their lifespan. However, scouring large buildings or extensive roads manually for cracks can be a daunting task. Therefore, this program aims to automate this process.

The objective of this program is to automatically identify the presence of cracks. Given images of concrete or pavement (or any flat surface), the program classifies them as negative (no cracks) or positive (cracks present) with an accuracy of ~93%.
